	<text>Saxophone Wail, Jazz
Make Indians Wild
Again, Says Pastor
Philadelphia, Jan. 21.—Modern
jazz music and dancing are making
the Indians wild again. The roll of
the snare drum and the wail of the
saxophone, combined with the "tod
dle" and the "shimmy" stir atavistic
memories of the tom-tom and the
shriek of the victim at the stake.
So asserted Dr. Henry Beets of
Grand Rapids, Mich., secretary of
missions of the Christian Reformed
church, in an address Friday before
the session of the Friends of the
Indian.
A resolution he introduced seek
ing to forbid Indian youths and girls
from dancing the modern steps, was
adopted and will be sent to the In
dian bureau of the department of
the interior at Washington.</text>

	<text>Just what is jazz? One has a vague idea of a dis
orderly number of sounds played entirely for dancing.
But jazz has a far deep.r significance. It is an attempt
to reproduce the marvelous syncopation of the African
Jungle. It is the result of the savage musican's won
derful gift of progressive retarding and acceleration
which is guided by his sense of ewing. He who would
play ja^z nnut have rhythmic aggressiveness. As one
iran put it, ja: z music is the rtelirum tr mens of suyco
pL.i'on. It n strict rhythm without melody.
The words ja;, jazz, jazz, J&3Z, and jascz are of
Afrcan origin but come direct form the Creole patois
and idiom meaning "speed things up." For in th> old
plantation days when the slaves were having one of their
rare holidays an fun would languish, some West Coast
African would say, "jazz hdT up," and then things would
go fast and furious. Today "jazz her up," is still a
slang expression with the same meaning.
There are two types of jazz: One originating in
China, which is called Siames 3 music, and the other
originating in Africa having only a general name of
jazz applied to it. Since the Siamese music or Oriental
jazz, as it is often called, stay:d strictly in China and
underwent no futher development it is not important.
But the jazz that originated in Africa, or the Occidental
jazz is known the world ov-r and because of its impor
tance w> will trace its growth only.
Occidental jazz first came to life on the West Coast
of Africa. There big sturdy warriers danced to tli? music
of throbbing Tom —Toms while the entire jungle was
the accompanying orchestra.
Then it spread, reaching Cuba thru deported slaves.
It found a rich soil there for its growth, since the
jungles of Africa were not so different from the swamps
of Cuba. All of that "Hula Hula stuff," goes straight
back to Africa for its origin. Then jazz was transplanted
into America, entering from the south and creeping
up until it covered all of America. About that time the
war broke out and when our boys went to Europe and
and especially to France they took their beloved jazz
with them. So Paris was initiated into a new world of
music over which they promptly went wild.
But jazz has found her strongest support in the
United States. When jazz arived in America via New
Crleans it almost died leaving only a little spark fostered
by the slaves and New Orleans underworld. For years
jazz has ruled the New Orleans underworld resorts,
thei>- natrons dancing to jazz for gladsome generations
Ragtime and the new dances came from there. Then
slowly, little by little, jazz crept up the Missippi from
resort to resort until it landed in Chicago at Freiburg's
whither it had been proceded by stanzas of "Must I
Hesitate"? "The Blues", 'Frankie and Johnnie," and
other classics of the levee underworld that seems to
please the savage part of us. From there it spread
like wild fire all over the United States, hitting the
Middle West the hardest and the extreme East the
lightest. Jazz has reigned supreme for some years and
CAYTON'S MONTH! V
most likely, will reign for many more for it has invaded
our dance halls, theaters, and concert halls. Even our
churchs have not escaped without their share of tem
petious music. It has even snatched our very song»,
classical and popular, and taken them for its own use
ragging them to death.
One use to think of a band as a group of respectable
looking beings usally with a splendid musical ability.
But when one gazes upon a jazz band he sees a bunch of
s .emingly demented men, contorting themselves and
their instruments far better than a St Vitis dancer.
For the modern jazz band is in reality a young army
artillery. The howitzers of the band ara stationed in
the trap drum, snare drum, cymbals, triangle, wooden
blocks, xylophone, cow bells, rattles and whistles for
the production of various weried noises. The trome
bones represent the field guns, the clarinets, oboes,
saxophones, auto homes and cornets furnish thol rapid
lire batteries. The range being point blank one can
easily s^e why the effect of the drum fire is so complete.
Some say that jazz is sensual. If so why has it
lived in America so long? For this reason: Jazz is of
tho ravage and therefore clemntal in its appeal. It is
bouterous, rough, but the very soul of kindly good
humor and care free merriment. It is the music siren
of the dance for while one is swept thru a neck breaking,
whirl-wind measura his own cares and responsibilities
are brushed aside. In America especially because we,
;00, are of a strenous nature, we nejd and must find
some sort of energetic exercise as a conteractant. The
old fashioned, dreamy waltez and graceful, measured
minuets are things of the past. The tired business man,
the worn out mother, the discouraged poet, as well as
the impatient youths, seek and find relief in jazz. Then
ddi not th dough boys find a wonderful solace in their
beloved jazz? For while under its throes they forgot
the bloody battle field, the stench of decaying bodies;
they even forgot there was such a thing as war. Then
jazz is d mocratic. It is simple enough for any one to
understand and enough of a vampire to coax every one
into a world of oblivion. Can we not then say that jazz
has existed for a purpose and has truly fulfilled that
purpos;.?
But on the other hand one must be careful that the
alluring god of jazz, Mumbo Jumbo, does not lead us so
far from the true god of music, Pan, that we fail to
appr ciate the real classic. Might not one thus uncon
sciouly sell his birth-right for a mess of pottage?
Because jazz is elemental bringing the savage to the
curface, it is dang rous. We cannot afford in our
present stage of civilization to accept the standard of
the savage even if it is only thru the giddy measure of
a dance. True jazz belongs to the "forest primeval"
and is mor: real and refined there than in a hall filled
with dancer.3. The very fact that the growth of jazz
las been thru the under world resorts of America is a
E rong po'nt in i's disfavor. In embrasing what we
now c..11 a necessary evil is there not a chance of jazz

	<text>JAZZ," that root of much
evil in music, a menace to
established rythmical law
and order and beauty and
grace, is dying its slow but natural
death
Syncopation which tends ^toward
"shimmying," wriggling and hop?
ping about dance floors as in the
days cf prehistoric barbarism is dis?
appearing and, according to those
authorities who make it their busi?
ness to study dancing, the demise of
"jazz" occasions more general joy
than sorrow. Puritanical grand?
mothers and perhaps less prudish
fathers and mothers who attend and
chaperon social dances of the young
need not much longer blush when
their eyes sweep the ballroom. The
youth of the nation may, after all,
grow up amidst less sensuous music
and dancing positions which em?
barrass their elders. A reaction
against this sort of thing is in full
swing in the United States and, like
a burned out plague, "jazz" music
and "jazz" dancing are leaving us.
While "jazz"' still retains its ad?
mirers and supporters, its own
ridiculousness has done more toward
it? eliminatii n than any other agen?
cy, believes Fenton T. Bott, presi?
dent of the American National As?
sociation, Masters of Dancing, who
is now in New York to attend the
thirty- annual convention of
that association, beginning August
25, at the Hotel Astor.
For Clean Dancing
The association, with it? more
than five hundred active members in
every city cf any r-ize in the UYiited
States and Canada, has been one of
the agencies working quietly since
the advent of "jazz" to keep danc?
ing clean and moral. In coopera?
tion with many civic and welfare so?
cieties throughout the country, much
has been done to eliminate the sala
ciou: and immoral features which
this form of syncopation brought
he dance floor.
"We do not recognize the terrr
'jazz,' which is purely a coined
word," Mr. Bot; told The Tribune
"We ever, recognize synco
d.we have nothing agai?.si
of syncopated music.
It can be playi i so brilliantly if
played right, and then again it can
ther form so sensu?

to the wild and irresponsible barba?
rism of the dark ages. We have

of the war swept the country witl

peared on the stage, and eventually
it audaciously entered the publi;

alike.
"There is a decided upward tren?
in music now, as compared with i

ter president. "New York, a leade

followed everywhere, is setting
cleaner pace. Compare New York'

There has been virtually no op?
position to the anti-jazz campaign
waged by his organization except
from a few unscrupulous dance hall
proprietors, said the president.
"Dancing is an essential," he
added. "What would tens of thou?
sands of people do nightly in New
York if they were not permitted to
go somewhere, meet socially, and
dance? If the places where these
people meet are decent there can be
no finer, more healthful or enjoy?
able recreation anywhere."
"What do you consider good or
bad positions in dancing?" he was
asked.
"It is difficult to illustrate posi?
tions," he answered. "Anyone can
see with a glance over the dance
floor wdiether positions are good or
bad. When you take hold of a girl
to dance, common sense and decency
should prompt your position. If your
attitude toward her is proper, you
will not crush your body against
hers nor place your cheek against
hers.
A Form of Exercise
"Clean dancing is an efficient
form of exercise, amusement and
recreation for both sexes. It devel?
ops muscle coordination which re?
sults in grace of movement. Girls
run, roll hoops and skip the rope
during their more youthful years
but later their play becomes more
sedentary, and should be supple?
mented by class exercises and
games. Dancing is one of these.
Dancing is likewise a mind quicken
er. By fixing the attention, bringing
to bear the force of will on the com?
plicated actions of the body, it edu?
cates the mental faculties. This is
especially true of aesthetic dancing,
during the performance of which
the muscles of the arms and trunk
are used, as well as those of the
legs.
"Sometimes the dancing school is
misunderstood," continued the mas?
ter. "The dishonest and unscrupu?
lous dance hall proprietor may give
the clean dancing academy a bad
name, just as some classes of thea?
ters may give the theater a bad
name. The theater is a great insti?
tution, but it is all wrong from the
wrong standpoint. The same is true
of dancing and dancing schools. The
wrong angle may be applied to them
just as to the theater.
To Ask Church's Aid
The American National Associa?
tion during its coming convention in
New York will renew a long-studied
effort to gain the cooperation of the
Methodist Church in the promotion
of clean dancing. This denomina?
tion takes a stand in its "blue laws"
against dancing in any form, and
during the last General Conference,
some years ago, a resolution to
amend the "blue laws" was voted
down. A group of "progressive"
Methodists, led by J. Henry Smythe,
of New York, is to-day avowedly in
favor of dancing, and will carry the
fight into the next Methodist General
Conference. The "conservatives"
are said to be adamant in their re?
fusal to lift a ban prescribed almost
half a century ago on many forms of
amusement.
"Dancing is older than Christi?
anity," said the president of the
dancing masters. "It will live so
long as there is music. It is our
struggle to keep this form of amuse?
ment clean and moral, and we feel
that the Methodist Church can do
more for humanity by helping us
than by opposing dancing in general.
It is only the older and more con?
servative Methodists who now op?
pose dancing. Younger Methodists
favor it."
Allied with the dancing masters'
organization against what is termed
improper music and dancing, many
social and civic societies have
been doing their part. A pamphlet
issued by the organization, contain?
ing "Rules, Regulations and Sugges?
tions Governing S^pcial Dancing,"
j has been distributed by the thousand
^y social welfare societies and the
H-elfare department of the United
States government. Universities
and colleges, demanding authorita?
tive knowledge on proper and im?
proper dancing during school func?
tions, have beer, supplied with these
rules and regulations almost every
where in the United States.
The Actors' Eejuity Association,
?m organization composed of thou?
sands of actors and actresses, is an
able element allied against forms of
music and dancing which might tend
toward a bad effect on the general
public.
The dancing masters have success?
fully solicited the cooperation of
"^ong publishers, who have in turr?
i toned down suggestive titles and
Mthographs on sheet music. Phonr?
graph companies, spending tens o?
thousands of dollars monthly in
j brightly colored magazines, have
been prevailed upon to make their
advertising less "jazzy."
The General Federation of Worn
j en's Clubs, one of the most active
agencies in the United States, is
working for music reform. At the
biennial conference in June at D.es
Moines a resolution was passed con?
demning popular songs which smack
of vulgarity and initiating an open
campaign for better American music.
Mrs. Marx E. Oberndorf er (Anne
Shaw Faulkner), cf Chicago, wife
of the famous pianist, selected na

dancing with their faces together
show such extreme* bad taste that
it should be unnecessary even to call
attention to it."
"All in all," says President Fenton
Botts, "the campaign has done much
to cleanse modern dancing, but
'jazz,' the root if it all, has done
more to eliminate itself than all the
campaigns.
"The American 'jazz' craze has
been like a popular celebration?for
a day or two all is enthusiasm, flags
and speeches. Soon it wanes and

Jazz, he believes, is now dying

	<text>"Jazz, for example, I think, was invented
by imps for the torment of imbeciles. True,
it does not contain any distinct immoral
teaching, because music is not a didactic
art, but jazz does contain a real immoral
influence, because it confuses, bewilders, be
numbs and befuddles the mind through the
ears. It Is, in effect, the dope or knockout
drop In the art of sound,
"Laws against immoral art? Yes. I sup
pose every civilized community has found
It necessary to have something of that kind,
otherwise we should have cartloads of filth
dumped at our back doors every morning;
but these laws, it should be remembered, are
very imperfect in their scope and uncertain
in their application. They can do a little
to help I's, but not very much. To rely
upon legislation as a safeguard against
immorality in art?that is, as a real safe
guard?Is a great mistake.</text>

and chaperones to help us elevate
dancing. We also appeal to musi
cians. They do not realize how much
help they can be. The way Is to cut
out so much "Jazz" and play the

Six months ago we pre
dicted that the dancing teachers' as

	<text>At the recent State convention of supervisors
of music in Michigan it was suggested that all
jazz be barred from the public schools. No
positive action was taken, but it was the senti
ment of those present that the jazz fever was
waning fast and that by simply discouraging the
stuff it would soon die of itself. Now that about
all the moans and groans and ghastly tones have
been trapped and exhibited there are no fresh
fields in the jazz domain. Even the merry dancers
have found that for a steady diet it is finer and
easier to frolic to the music of a sober and re
fined orchestra than to the ghastly revels of a
jazz band. 1 ho jazz has had its season an un
usually long one and another generation is at
the door ready to give it the ax. It may be able
to furnish its own requiem, but thats about all.</text>

	<text>Motions that Artists Err DRY Fled t
follow The Exact Ulflerence Between
Ambllaf Piscine Trotting and Galloplnsr
Prof Enclwoard MuybrUlgo delivered last
evening In the Turf Club Theatre an oxcood
Incly Interesting lecture upon tho attitudes of
animals In motion Illustrating I by photo
graphs made by Instantaneous process and by
a machine called tho zoOpraxIscopo which
caused animals and human beings to appear In
actual motion upon tho screen In a etartllnnly
lifelike manner Ho explained first tho In
iconlous apparatus by which those pictures
were made a series of twentyfour cameras
each fitted with an oloctrooxposor that ox
posed the negative to tho light forono fivethou
sandth of a second when an animal In motion
before It broko a thread and made the eloctrio
connection
connocton
The series of pictures thus produced repre
sented every movement of nny animal for the
observation of which this apparatus was em
ployod and revolutionized the old Ideas of the
motions of quadrupeds In their several gaits
especially of those of horses I bad boon a
matter of dispute whether the horse ever had
three feet on the ground at one time when
walking These pictures settled that lie
always has two foot on the ground and part of
tho time throe tho two feet being alternately
dlaKonals and laterals
Wherever a walking horse Is I supported on
two feot und tho suspended feet are inside tho
suspended feat are invariably on the same slue
where he Is supported on two extended foot
tho suspended foot Insldo are diagonals I a
horse drops tho left hind foot on the ground
the next to follow will b tho loft foro foot fol
lowed foro by the right hind and finally by tho right
Egyptian Assyrian and Roman pictures woro
shown to demonstrate that un erroneous Idea
ot this motion prevailed In the earliest attempts
at art I was perpetuated in tho famous
statue of Marcus Aurollus which has been tho
model of almost all equestrian statues to the
present day and is an conspicuous In tho
equestrian statues of Washington In Boston
and In Union Square a In any of the old
Egyptian or Assyrian pictures I Is not pos
sible for a hon t walk In the way thero de
pleted MoUsonlor had a correct Idea of a
homes walk when ho painted his trout picture
of Napoleon In 1814 but the critics ridiculed It
and pronounced It incorrect Now he has the
satisfaction of knowing that ho was right and
they woro all wrong Miss Thompson also was
correct and the critics derided hor for being so
Now tho laugh Is ou time other sldo
A dozen pictures were next shown Illustra
tive ol a horio ambling a gait In which ho Is
never altogether clear of the ground but Is sup
ported alternately by ono and two feet the
single foot being alternately a fore and a hind
foot and the two foot alternately laterals and
diagonals This was best understood when ac
tually represented by the zoopraxlscopo and
the demonstration was so perfect as to elicit
great applau from time spectators
Time racking or pacing gait was next amply
Illustrated In it the horse moves time lateral
foot simultaneously Instead of tho diagonal
foot as in the trot Then time trot was shown in
I an exhaustive series of photographs covering
every movement of a trotting horse both at a
slow and a fast trot In the latter the horse
was at ono point In his stride entirely off tho
u t s m
Ituuuu tuu titkiii Atiu nuu iiiu luw i uittj
clear and the others not qulto touching In a
fast trot time horse Invariably puts the heel
down first never the ball of time foot or toe
By an Ingenious arrangement live cameras
five pictures wore successfully made simulta
neously from different points of view for art
late use of horses In time several attitudes of
motion and several of these foreshortened ani
mals when thrown upon the screen wore
astonishingly comic however true to nature
they unquestionably were
The cantor was next shown in which during
a portion of his stride the horse has throe feet
on the ground and the fourth almost touching
it Then the gallop was Illustrated A fast
horse going rapidly Mr Muybridgo said will
bo in the air three times in u single stride he
believed but this was only his conjecture ar
guing from the illustrations he had obtained
Tho lecturer reverted attain to ancient his
tory showing the old Kgyptlan and Assyrian
models of the running horso models blindly
followed by artists ever since In which time
animal is presented poising himself on both
hind feet extended far behind with his fore
feet stretched far out ahead of him together
The North American Indians had a much more
correct Idea of the motion of u horse as was
demonstrated by their rude pictures upon a
butlulo robe that Lafayette bought when In this
country and took back with him to Paris
Time horselas ho appears In jumping was tho
subject of tIme final series of horse pictures
and alTordod some of tho most surprising and
brilliant effects of the zoopraxlscopo In re
sponse to a question of an auditor ua to
whether time horse In jumping tot his power
from his hind Itcs time lecturer replied that ho
undoubtedly did that ho raised time front part
of bin body with his foro legs und took his
spring from his hind lent In speaking of
horses jumping ho iiid that the horse of vv hlch
some of these pictures wero mado had risen
15 feet In front of a 3 ft C in hurdle cleared It
and allgutod 11 feet beyond it In alighting
from u tump time horse always lands first on his
fore foot with them DO or 4U Inches apart
Following these pictures were a long series
ot Illustrations of tho various gaits of oxen a
wild bull Newfoundland dog hound door
goat and hog In speaking the motions of
the ox Mr Mui bridge criticised iosa Uonhetir
sharply pointing out that In her picture of
three yokes off draught oxen laboring she
mlssedltho natural movements of the beasts
Tho goat runs like a liars and time deer like
the hound bounding rather than running In
ono part of time deers stride its attitude was
very near to that hlch artists have so long in
accurately made as that of time running horse
Then there worn many moro Instantaneous
photographs of Hamol walking and running
and jumping of athletes boxing turning plain
eomoriuults and twisting xomon aultH lla
zael was very much astonished at the various
attitudes In which he had unconsciously placed
himself I whon jumping remarked the lec
turer And I should think ho would 1st l re

	<text>THE KINETOGRAPH I
Edisons Latest Invention Where
by Motion
IS RECORDED THE SAME AS SOUND
By n Phonograph Is Nothing More nor
Less than a Photograph Camera Arranged
to Do New Work In a New Way
Special to TiE HERALD Examiner Dispatch
NEW YORK May 2SThree or four years
ago in a magazine article Edison the
electric wizard wrote that he would pro
duce a machine which should record and
reproduce motion as the phonograph re
corded and reproduced sound A little
while ago there was a great convention of
womens clubs of America Mrs Edison
is interested in womens clubs and their
work and she decided to entertain the
presidents of the various clubs at the con
vention Edison entered into the plan
and when 147 club women visited his work
shop ho showed them n working model of
his new kinetoeranh for that is the name
he has given to the most wonderful of all
his wonderful inventions Surprised and
pleased the club women saw a small pine
box standing on the floor There were
some wheels and bolts near the box In
the top of the box was a hole perhaps an
inch in diameter As they looked through
this hole they saw a pipture of a man I
was a most marvelous picture It bowed
and smiled and waved its hands and tool
off its hat with the most perfect natural
ness and grace Every motion was perfect
There was not a hitch or a jerk Recently
he went to Chicago While there sqme
one interested in the Worlds fair
asked him if he was going to
get up some electrical novelty to place on
exhibition I have machine projected
replied Edison but the details
repled dotais are not per
fected yet My intention is to have such a
happy combination of electricity and
holography that a man can sit in his own
parlor and see reproduced on a screen the
forms of players in an opera produced on a
distant stage and as ho sees their move
meats hflwill hear the sound of their voices
as they talk or sing or laugh When theth
machine is perfected which it will be long
before it can be exhibited at tho fair each
little muscle of the gingers face will be
eon by the world His facial expression
with every change will be exactly repro
puced and the stride and positions will be
natural and will vary as ao those of tho
person himself
When this interview was published hero I
a couple of weeks ago people laughed again
and said Edison had been having fun with
some Chicago reporter Edison sat in
court all day Tuesday during the argument
of his counsel for an injunction to restrain
the United States Electric Light company
from making incandescent lamps A re
porter asked him about this phenomenal
machine and was invited to go out to I
his laboratory at Orange and see a model L
of the machine This morning thE repor
erfound Mr Edison at his laboratory and L
showed him a copy of the Chicago interview I
Edison Lead it and lau ha Yes tis
true he said You can sit i your par I
lor and look ata big screen and seeTChaun i
coy Depew come out just asif he was intro i
ducing Stanley at the Metropolitan opera
house He will walk up to the front of f
the stage bow and smile and take a drink
of water and start off with his oration
oraton
Every time your eyes see him open his
mouth your ears will hear what he says
that is i he says anything
How do you expect to do all that Mr
Edison 1
I it is desired to reproduce an opera or
play I will get a company to give a dress
rehearsal for me I place back of the orchestra
chestra on a table a compound machine
consIsting of a phonograph and a kineto
graph with a capacity of thirty minutes
continuous work The orchestra plays
the curtain rises and the opera begins
Both machines work simultaneously on
recording the sound and the other taking
holographs recording motion at the
rte of fortysix photographs per sec
ond Afterward the photographic
strip is developed and placed in
the machine A projecting lens is substi
tuted for a photographic leus and the re
producing part of the phonograph is adjusted
justed Then by means of a calcium light
the effect is reproduced life size on a white I
curtain reproducing to the audience the
original scene with all its sounds and all
he motions of the actors exactly as in the
original scene
phonograph which MrEdison will use
in his compound motion and sound repro
ducer will be an improvement on the
phonographs now in common use He said
today he had now in use about five hun
dred phonographs of which ho has taken
constant observations The result of all
these observations ho will embody in an
improved phonoaraph to be used with the
kinetograph
The kinetograph is nothing more nor less
i than a photograph camera arranged in a
new way to do new work In this small
box camera Mr Edison places a roll of
golatine film about threequarters of an
inch wide and of any length desired The
interior of the camera of course is arranged
on a plan similiar to that on which the or
dinary roll cameras are made The gelatine
strip is unrolled from one spindle and re
rolled on another and in passing from the
first spindle to the second is carried before
the lens of the camera The shutters of the
camera are arranged to be worked by the
shaft attached to the oyclinder of the
phonograph This shaft also works the
spindles which carry the rolls of film The
machanicsm of this camera is so arranged
that when shutters open the spindles stop
and the gelatine film is fixed before the
lens In less than the fortysixth part of a
second the photograph is taken the shut
ters snap tho spindles turn and the gelatine
slip moves on for a new photograph The
arrangement is so complete that fortysix
perfect photographs are taken in one
second
The trouble with all attempts heretofore
made t reproduce action and motion by
photograph said Edison was the photo
graphs could not be taken in a series with
sufficient rapidity to catch accurately the
motion it was desired to reproduco My
idea was to take a series of instantaneous
photographs of motions so rapidly that in
the reproduction the photographic repre
sentatives become resolved into I pure
motion instead of I series of jerks The
kinetograph takes a series of fortysix
photographs in one second and keeps it up
as long as desired It starts moves stops
uncloses the shutter takes a photograph
closes the shutter and starts on fortysi
times a second The result when repro
duced Is a pure motion
To illustrate what he said Mr Edison
took ono of the rolls of gelatine film which
had been through the kinetograph and
showed it the reporter On it was photo
graphed one of tho boys in his laboratory
The photographs were about half an inch
square and were taken in the film at inter
vals of about an inch They represented
the boy in the act of taking off his hat and
bowing Between the first view and the
last of the series the complete motion of
removing the hat and making the bow was
cleanly diacernoble but between any two
consecutive views there was no apparent
change in the position of the boys arm or
band In the front view the boys band
was at his side Gradually it was raised to
ward his head and his head inclined forward
Then the hat was removed and the bow
completed after which the hat was re
placed
To reproduce perfectly a complete
record of a pure motion continued Mr
r
Edison it is necessary tho photographs
should be taken at tho rate of fortysix per
second any smaller number would show
irregularities and a break in the motion
There was a machine mado a while
ago to print pictures of an object in motion
but it would not work fast enough It re
produced imperfect and jerky motion
like this And he illustrated by raising
his arm in a series of short jerks to his
shoulder
How did find out that fortysix photo
graphs must be taken every second Well
Ive been experimenting with this thing for
a long time now Ivo got it that is Ive
got the germ or base principle When you
got your base principle right then it is only
a question of time and a matter of details
about completing the machine The details
can all bo worked out after you get the
germs Come up stairs and see tho germ
work
I is a question which part of tho kineto
graph Edison himself regards as the great
est part of his invention the arrangement
for taking tho photographs or the contriv
ance for reproducing them I was the re
producing contrivance which he showed to
the reporter as the germ r
To outward appearance tho germ is
nothing but a pine box which looks very
much as i it might have been originally in
tended as a packing case for shoes or
boots I stood on end in front of a lathe
and the open top was nearest to tho
the lathe In the upper end was cut a hole
about an inch in diameter and in this hole
was set a lens On the bottom of the box
was arranged a series of wheels and
seres
spindles A roll of gelatine film was placed
on a spindle on one side of the bottom The
end of tho gelatine strip was then carried
over one of the wheels and past the lens in
the hole in tho top of the box and another
spindle on the other side of tho
box bottom and fastened to a small
belt that ran from the lathe to the shaft
tle
on which was set the spindle to which the
end of the gelatino film was fastened
When the motor was turned on the roll of
gelatine strip was transferred from the
first spindle to the second and in the trans
fer passed under the lens The photo
graphs on the slip came out as the germ
A s it was worked fast or slow the repro
duction showed apure motion or a series of
jerks When it was run at the highest
speed tho reporter saw a young fellow
waving his hand and touching his hat Af
ter running tho germ for a while at full
speed Edison had it slowed down a little
A t once a difference bncamo apparent and
th reasons of the failure of the machino
to which Edison had referred him
were quite evident Instead of reproduc
ing a smooth pure motion the strip showed
under the lens a lazy indifferent young
fellow who moved himself by jerks and
whoso actions were abrupt and unsteady
In a few weeks Mr Edison will be ready
to make a test of the practical powers of
the germ on a much larger scule In the
office of the laboratory he has had an im
mense screen put up sucn as is used for
storeoptican exhibitions The screen
hangs over a big fireplace and colors the
side of the wall As soon as he can perfect
some little details of the kintograph ho will L
make a trial at life size of the reproduction I
of this big succes Mr Edison says the
kintograph can be made to run for any de
sired length of time
I can put a roll of gala tne strip a mil I
long into it if I like said its inventor to
day The work it will do in half an houi
is something astonishing Taking forty
six photographs per second in half an hour
there will be 82800 photographs on a gela
tine strip
I tne photographs were half an inch
squrae and half an inch apart the strip of
film used in taking the thirtyminute of
an opera would be 0000 feet long and Mr
Edison would need something more than
his mile of gelatine Therd is not one of
us who has not seen theidea in use hun
dreds of times Children in the streets
have for playthings little windmills whose
painted arms embody the very idea Edison
ha used in the kintograph One arm will
have a part of a figure painted the next
arm andther part the ext another and so
on and as the arms whirl rapidly around
one looking on sees only a perfect picture
That is the whole scheme</text>

and cold Edison Is well named the wiz
ard he is the great magician of science
and we have grown somewhat accustomed

the time has come to get excited Noth

	<text>EDISON'S LATEST
A new inventlop by Thomas A Edison
was shown to a few favored persons at the
West Orange laboratory one evening last
week. The new machine is really a grown
up kinetoscope and it is a success in the
opinion of the New York Herald.
Mr Edison calls bin latest invention the
vitascope which be says means a machine
showing lifo and that is exactly what the
new apparatus does
The vitascope which has been in process
of perfection at the Llewellyn laboratory for
tire last seven or eight months under Mr.
Edisn's direction Is the ideal ha had in
mind he says when he began work on the
kinetoscopo machine with which he has
never been satisfied.
The vitascope is an improvement of the
kinetoscope by which moving life size figures
ures of men women and animals are thrown
upon a screen by means of bright lights and
powerful lenses. The trial of the new machine
chine was made in a cold corner o1 the big
foundry at the works and Mr. Edison with
Richard N. Dyer William J Gilmour manager
ager of the phonograph works Rap Cam-
men of New York and a few invited guests
huddled around a red hot stove and gazed
at and admired the marvelous figures thrown
upon a big white screen at coo end of the
room
The first picture shown was a colored pano-
ranma of a serpentine dance by Anabelle svho
went out to West Orange to pose one day
last summer The film roll on which the
photographs were attached was arranged over
a half dozen spools apd pulleys and the machine
chino was sot in motion
Even the inventor himself was surprised
at the result although with ills usual critical
ical eye ho discovered flaws in the com which
lie declared must be disposed o1 before the
vitascope would come up to his ideal
Anabelle danced for five minutes and then
a panorama of the latest English Derby was
thrown upon the screen
The feature of the new maehino which as-
toniehed all who saw the views was the almost
most entire absence of vibration In the plc-
tures as they appeared on the screen and
which had been the hardest obstacles to surmount
mount 1n perfecting the apparatus
The original photographs as by time kineto-
scope and developed on the film roll are
about the size of a special delivery postage
stamp and to produce a life size picture they
are magnified about abc hundred times. Of
course each vibration of the com or the apparatus
paratus which rovaives It Is magnified l like
proportion and every previous do
away with this vibration lad been unsuccessful
ful
Mr. Edison expects to be able soon to improve
prove time pilonograph so ho will bo able to
take records double the length of these
which the present'cyllnders will contain and
the vitascope and phonograph will then hose
so combined that It will be possible for an
audl011ce to watch a photograpldo repfodue-
tion of a grand opera and hear the singers
and see the acting with as much distinctness
of sound and vision as if they were in the
opera house</text>

	<text>THIS is that time of the year when, on tha brink of a Hollywood
vacation, you should make up your mind what you like about
Hollywood before you get there, and what you don't like, and
then see what the score is after you get back. And it Is a
fitting moment to ponder over some of the foibles of the ^ast season
and lid yourself of the burden both of grudges and of their opposites
and be ready to start all over again after Hollywood's dust has been
shaken from your feet.
At this final sitting Hollywood seems to us to be a land of work,
play, too much emphasis on some players and not enough 011 others,
and a general waste of time for those who don't hit the high spots.
We also have an idea that it is composed of a great many groups
and circles which are more or less closed corporations and that an
outsider hasn't any more idea than the man in the moon about what
really goes on.
Further than that. we know it must
be a hospitable plan', from the cour
tesies already extended an about-to-be
traveler in those lands. Otherwise wv
visualize it as a sandy patch with a
beach, several hotels, thousands of i
studios and a great many actors prowl
ing around and looking hungry.
We are, however, indebted to Holly
wood for the follow lug reasons during
the past few months:
"THE STRANGER'S RETURN"—
Because it should prove to some oi the
old fogies th: t the films are no longer
an infant industry ami that ihey can
produce a picture which is better than
the book from which it was taken.
ANN HARDING Because she is an
Intelligent actress who walks, talks and
acts like a lady, and one who. while
she can look like a spinster one minute,
can also look like a red-hot "number"
the next.
"MAMA TOVES PAPA"- Because
It is one of tli first films which hasn't
bent way over backward to be funny—
but it was funny Just because Mary
Boland and Charles happen to be
funny.
MIR JAM HOPKINS-Because she is
an alive and arresting personality, who
Is equally at ease playing "bad" and
"good" roles.
FRANCHOT TONE—Because you
would never know that he got a cum
laude in French at Cornell.
LEE GARMES Because he did what
no one has ever done before In "Zoo in
Budapest"—make the camera the be
all and the end-all of the picture, and
still retain the human, vital quality
of the story material.
CLARK GABIJS Because^ he still
hangs on as the screen's most noted
"smoothie and in spite of his popu-
larity with ladies, manages to act quite
niceiy. as In "Hold Your Man."
WHEELER AND WOOI£EY—B«
cause they have been as silent as the
night for the past few months.
RUDY VALLEE Because W. CI
Fields turned him off in "International
House."
KAY FRANCIS —Because she rose j
way above some of the sordid trash of
"Mary Stevens. M. D." and made the
heroine during the first part seem as
good if not better than life.
"DOUBLE HARNESS" -Because it
provided an amusing evenUig's enter
tainment and one which neither
preached nor tormented.
LOUISE CLOSSER HALE—Because
She was a grand trouper and a grand
person up until the minute she died—
her last work in "Another Language"
summing up the verve and spirit of her
long career.
GEORGE ARLISS—Because in "Vol
taire" he makes the man look like the
portrait of Voltaire and acts as the
gentleman himself musi have acted.
SHE DONE HIM WRONG" B<
cause it is the sort of film which can
do no harm and pjtsibly no good
mind seeing >.v« r again.
mind seeing over again.
MARI.ENE DIETRICH-Because htr
beauty In "Song of Songs" Is some
thing to write home about.
HF.I EN HAYES Bscause she has
never turned In a mediocre peri'oim
unce.
ROBERT MONTGOMERY Becausc,
while he can be the most irritating per
son in the films, he is also the only
exponent of that ageless school of "ju
veniles" who can act as well as look
like a collar advertisement.
MARION DAVIES Because she has
the courage to go ahead and say thai
she v^jll do "The Barretts of Wim
pole Street' when she knows that she
Is the last actress on earth who should
do it.
PAUL MUNI—Because he has said
that the picture Is more important than
the star, and that, therefore, he re
fuses to be starred.
"ZOO IN BUDAPEST" and FARE- 1
WELI, TO ARMS' Because they ar.'
our favorite films.</text>

David O. Selznick's career is screen drama
climb and contrast.
Hollywood once called him Sure-Thing
Selznick because, ran the charge, he lacked
imagination and wouldn't take chances. Now
they call him Sure-Thing Selznick again, for
a sounder reason.
The League of Nations award went to
"Little Lord Fauntleroy." "Viva Villa" and
"Anna Karenina" had already won, in suc
cessive years, the Mussolini Cup of the Inter
national Exposition in Rome. A catalog of
honors accorded "David Copperfield" would
fill a page.
Serious faced, almoet solemn, with brown
eyes that stare in intensity, the thirty-four
year-old producer looks like a post-graduate
law student and habitually works until three
o'clock in the morning.
To understand what he is and what he
thinks, the dramatic facts of this producer's
rise are vital.
Observe him at the start. He stands, in
1922, twenty years old, on Park Avenue,
fingering the sum total of his earthly posses
sions one silver dollar. His father, Lewis
J. Selznick, a master showman of hie time,
has been caught in one of the over-expansion
waves that cursed the motion picture in
dustry's early growth. Gone to the creditors
are homes, cars, comforts.
Young Selznick has the offer of a good, safe
clerkship. But, since earliest childhood, he has
spent his playtime listening to his father talk
showmanship. He makes his decision:
"I will again put the name Selznick at the
head of a great producing organization."
David spent that last dollar in a barber
shop. He went, with a plan, to a man he knew.
The man financed him for $2000. That was to
be tops. "Don't come back for more."
Then due to arrive from Argentina was
Sefior Luis Angel Firpo, the Wild Bull of the
"DAVID COPPERFIELD"
SELZNICK SEARCHED
TWO YEARS TO
FIND A BOY WHO
COULD PLAY THIS
RÔLE TO SUIT HIM
"SERIOUS
FACED. ALMOST
SOLEMN. WITH
BROWN EYES
THAT STARE IN
INTENSITY"
That's what Hollywood calls
this producer of hit movies
but he gambled his last
dollar on a haircut
to get a start
by
Lupton A.Wilkinson
•A TALE OF TWO CITIES" WAS
ANOTHER TRIBUTE TO HIS GENIUS
Pampas, ballyhooed to take the heavyweight
boxing crown from Jack Dempsey.
Selznick met him at the boat.
"I want to star you in a motion picture."
"But surely!" The Seftor was delighted.
"The price for my services will be one thou
sand dollars a day."
"Agreed. Meet me on the roof at such and
such an address tomorrow morning."
Selznick shot the whole picture in one day
on that roof. He had to. A second day would
have bankrupted him.
Titled "Will He Beat Dempsey?" the timely
special netted its producer a $3000 profit.
Selznick then induced Rudolph Valentino
to review a bathing girl parade at Madison
Square Garden. He photographed this from
every possible angle, edited it well and cleared
another $5000.
"If 1 am not a producer," reasoned David,
"what am I?" He took the next train for
Hollywood. Every studio there shut a door
in his face. For two years, on Poverty Row, he
struggled with quickies, the lowliest form of
picture production.
Finally a producer grew tired of saying no.
He named Selznick
y assistant to an asso
ciate producer. That's
Hollywood for stooge.
There was trouble the first
day. The picture being prepared
was from a book. David argued
with his chief concerning what
the author meant. He was impu
dent or insolent and received
two weeks' grace.
Then followed a bitter year at
odd jobs. At last he was assigned
to produce westerns.
One day he came back to the
studio with two pictures instead
of one.
"What's this?" the head of
the studio wanted to know.
"What's this?"
"Well, it occurred to me,"
said David, "that if I took on
location one supporting cast, but
two scripts and two heroes and
two heroines, I could make two
pictures as easy as one."
Hollywood hailed the coup as
executive brilliance. beiznicK
grinned:
"I had to figure some way to attract atten
tion to a maker of wester/
He was offered an ass> tant producership,
with escape from horse o; ra. Years of success
followed, and all Hollywood took off its hat.
The young man took off his own hat to
Louis B. Mayer's daughter, whom he married
that year.
Looking back, in the light of today, we can
see Selznick's special talent, amounting per
haps to genius, beginning to express itself. In
"The Animal Kingdom" he established Leslie
Howard as a screen star and gave Mvrna Lov
her first straight part. He introduced Katha
rine Hepburn to the screen in "A Bill of
Divorcement" and cast her in "Little Women,"
her greatest triumph. He brought Fred
Astaire to films, in "Dancing Lady." His
remarkable flare for casting has added to hie
fame. It caused him to search for two yeans
and lift from obscurity a little English boy
who won the world as David Copperfield and
re-won it as Little Lord Fauntleroy.
"The characters in a Selznkk picture," one
critic said, "seem as if they could be portrayed
only by the actors in the roles."
After Selznick had done some of his finest
work including "Viva Villa," "Dinner at
Eight," "David Copperfield," and "A Tale of
Two Cities" Mr. John Hay (Jock) Whit
ney offered the backing for that independent
company of which he had dreamed. His first
release was "Little Lord Fauntleroy."
Granted a few minutes in the midst of pre
paring for "Gone With the Wind." day
dreaming of "Tom Sawyer," casting "The
Prisoner of Zenda" and finishing "A Star is
Born," I came to business:
"What is the secret? How do you do it,
over and over?"
Selznick said:
"Oh, I've had luck, lots of luck with
originals. But nobody needs luck to make a
great picture from a great book or play.
"Writers, directors and actors grow im
patient with me. They all want to improte the
story that has stood the test, when all they
need to do is to understand it and keep to its
spirit.
"When I selected 'Little Women' for pro
duction— I didn't actually produce' it
everyone argued: 'You can't let the bespec
tacled German professor get the girl not
on the screen."
'How do you know?' I demanded. 'How
can you be sure that hundreds of thousands
of people who loved this book would have
loved it more some other way? We bought
"Little Women," and we'll make "Little
Women.
Selznick walked from behind the desk. Ex
citement lit his face.
"We'll do the same with 'Tom Sawyer'," he
said. "We'll do better. Already smart people
are telling me what an old-fashioned story
structure the book has, how we could improve
it." He smiled. "I'll string along with Mark
Twain."</text>

AMUSEMENTS
TELLS nOW THE
PHOTOPLAYS ARE COLORED
Manager J one of the Iris and Bonita
Theatres Has Made Study of
the Subject.
Following the announcement that
The Sultana," a motion picture in
natural colors, wfth Ruth Roland as
the star, would be presented at the
Bonita theatre, the editor has re
ceived many requests for informa
tion as to how colored films are pro
duced. Since Manager Jones is In
terested In the subject and has made
somewhat of a study of it, he was
asked to give the readers of this pa
per the benefit of his knowledge.
"There are two ways of coloring a
picture," he said. "One is by colored,
photography that Is, In the actual
taking of the picture the colors are
obtained; the other Is photographing
the scenes in black and white, like
the ordinary motion picture, and then
coloring them by hand. It might be
supposed that the first method is the
best; this, however, is not so since
the Invention of what is known as
the Pathecolor process.
"In coloring films, the Pathe pro
cess Is superior to that of any other
manufacturer, and is better than any
photography in colors. In the first
place, colored photography requires
more film; in the second, it Is more
or less oqaque. Pure white are al
most Impossible; the Pathe process
gives pure whites. Colored Photo
graphy requires special device on
the projection machine. It Is often
blurry, is very hard on the eyes, re
quires double intensity of current and
an absolutely darkfSm. Audiences
object to rery darktlieatres. Laws
have been passed in. many places re
quiring a certain amount of light
and most of the criticism which was
attached to motion picture theatres
in early days arose from the fact
that they were so dark.
"When 'iU la remembered that there
are sixteen pictures to each foot of
film, and that each of these little pic
tures is colored by hand, you can Im
agine the enormity of the task nec
essary to the Pathecolor process. A
five-reel film such as The Sultana,
which we are to show at the Bonita
on tomorrow requires' painting on
80,000 pictures. While this la a big
lob, the results justify it, as Pathe
colored films are startling In their
beauty.</text>

	<text>—Following receipt by the National
Broadcasting Co. of protests from all
parts of the Nation against Mae
West’s broadcast of last Sunday, in
which Edgar Bergen and his Charlie
McCarthy dummy and Don Ameche
were also entangled, the following de
•wlopments appeared to be rapidly
crystallizing:
1. A Legion of Decency crusade
against radio suggestiveness, similar
in scope and purpose to the effective
campaign brought against the motion
picture industry early in 1934.
2. Closer surveillance by motion
picture producers over air activities
of their stars, with special depart
ments set up in each studio to ap
prove material used by all participants
on each air program.
3. Possible postponement of release
date for Miss West’s new picture,
already completed and listed for early
January showing, until public indigna
tion cools.
While Emanuel Cohen, producer of
Miss West’s new picture, “Every
Day’s a Holiday," was said to be de
bating advisability of adjourning its
release date until turmoil over the
broadcast shows signs of abatement,
all other Hollywood producers were
talcing steps to insure the box office
standing of their players against fur
ther questionable program participa
tion.
To prevent chances of a repetition
the studios, it was declared, will de
mand opportunity to inspect finished
scripts in which their players appear,
even in the most minor roles, at least
24 hours before the program goes on
the air.
In addition, an official representa
tive of the producer would be assigned
to all final rehearsals. His decision
on questionable material would be re
spected, at least as far as the partici
pation of the screen player was con
cerned.
It was Miss West’s invasion of pic
tures in 1933 and her salty produc
tions of "She Done Him Wrong” and
"I’m No Angel” that focused the at
tention of moral crusaders on the
•creen a year later.
The Joseph I. Breen morals code
department of the Hays organization
was then set up as a conciliatory ma
neuver to avert the general boycott
called by the Legion of Decency.
While the text of Miss West’s sub
sequent pictures were lifted somewhat
in moral tone, her insinuating inflec
tions have remained to torture cen
sors.</text>

	<text>TALE OF HORROR
Eleven Bodies Found Buried in
Farmhouse Yard.
HAD BEEN MURDERED.
Anxiety of John Helgelein Over Dis
appearance of His Brother Leads
to Discover}- of Murdered Bodies
of Two Men, a Woman juid Two
Children in Yawl of Woman Re
cently Burned to Death.
A dispatch from Laparte, Ind., s?/s
one of the most grewscme murder
mysteries ever unearthed in that sec
tion of the country came to light
Tuesday when the bodies of five per
sons, all of Urem murdered, were
found in the yard in the home of
Mrs. Belle Gunness, who, wittr three
of her children was burned to death,
on the night of April 28:
So far only two of the bodies have
been identified. These are Andrew
Helelee, who came to that city front
Aberdeen, S. D., for the purpose of
marrying Mrs. Gunness, whose ac
quaintance he had made through a
matrimonial bureau. Tht other is
that of Jennie Olson GunneSs, a-Chi
cago girl, who had been adopted by
Mrs. Gunness. She disappeared in
September, 1906, and it was said had
gone to Los Angeles to attend school.
The other bodies were those of a.
man and two children, apparently 13
years old.
The body of Helgenein was dis
membered and the arms, legs, trunk
and head were buried in different
parts of th yard. It is believed by
the authorities that Guy Lamphere,
who has been under arrest since the
burning of the Gunness home, on
the charge of murdering Mrs. Gun
ness and her family, committed the
Helgelein crime, Lamphere is a car
penter and the manner in which tho
body of Hlgelcin was dismembered
leads to the belief that it was done t
by somebody familiar with the use
of a saw.
In some quarters it is believed that
Mrs. Gunness may have known some
thing of the murderers of the five,
people.
A possible solution of the Gunness I
farm mystery, which was deepened
Wednesday when four additional bod
ies were found in the barn yard, de
veloped Wednesday night. Evidence
tending to show that the nine dis
membered corpses une arthed Tues
day and Wednesday had been ship
ped to Laporte, probably from Chi
cago, came to light. The testimony
of draymen who had carted trunks
and boxes to the Gunness home lent
color to this supposition. The La
porte police also received information
that two trunks, consigned to ,'Mrs.
Belle Gunness, Laporte, Ind." are
help in an express office in Chicago.
Two of the nine mutilated bodies
were identified with reasonable cer
tainty. Anton Olson, of Chicago,
viewed the body supposed to be that
of Jennie Olson, 16 years old, foster
daughter of Mrs. Gunness, and pro
nounced it to be that of his daughter.
A sister of the girl, Mrs. Leo Olan
der, of Chicago, confirmed the
father's identification.
Ask K. Helegein. whose inquires
regarding his missing brother, An
drew, led to the first dscovesies on
the death haunted farm, became sure
that the largest and best preserved
of the corpses is that of his brother.
Against this identification, however,
is the result of the autopsy perform
ed on this body by Dr. J. H. Meyer.
He found conditions which, to hia
mind, proved that the man perished
long after Andrew Helegein disap
peared last January. Dr. Meyer said
the corpse showed evidence of having
been in the ground less than two
weeks. Ask Helegein, however, re
fused to be convinced by these find
ings, and hisNcertainty led the coroner
to accept his 'Identificatlcn for the
-present.

	<text>Finding of Nine Bodies in Yard
Reveals Mysterious Whole
sale Killings.
WOMAN CALLED A BLTJEBEAED
Supposed Death of Herself and Chil
dren in Fire Only Adds to
the Puzzle.
Wholesale murder murder more
ruthlessly premeditated and diabolical
ly executed than the famous Holmes
castle crimes in Chicago was revealed
at Laporte Ind. Tuesday when five
mutilated bodies were dug up in the
back yard of the home of Mrs. Bella
Gunness who together with her three
children are supposed to have met
death when their house burned one
week before.
Fifteen persons already have a place
on the list of known or probably slain
and circumstances point to Mrs. Gun-
ness as the arch-conspirator in at least
twelve of the crimes. Until this time it
i had been accepted as true that she and
j her three children had met death in the
fire that destroyed their home but now

the suspicion arises that the bodies that
p
were found in the smoldering ruins
were brought from some hospital or
medical school for the purpose of cre-
j ating the belief that Mrs. Gunness and
her family had pas.sed from existence.

with Mrs. Gunnos.s. Uo had declared
about town she was trying to "iret rid"
of him because he knew too much. He
has told several conilictini stories
concerning his relation with the wom
an and his presence in the neighbor
hood of the Gunness home the night it
burned.
The discovery of the Ixnlies led ex-
pressim'ii to tell of the delivery of five
trunks to the Guiines-s farm during the
last six months. This fact has caused
the authorities to incline to the theory
that the place may have been a "clear
ing-house" for murders. They suspect
that wealthy person after being lured
to Chicago and killed may have l een
packed into thc-c trunks sent to La
porte and disjio etl of there. Lamphere
in his cell declared Mrs. Gunness fre-
nivntly asked him to buy poison for
her. She wanted chloroform he said.
Four of the bodies were found buried
in a refuse pile about 150 feet from the
house while another body was duir
up within a few teet of the ruined
home. It is he opinion of Coroner
Mack and physicians who examined the
bodies that th 'y were burned after
death. Ilelirelein was easily identified
by his brother although the remains
had been badly mutilated. The body
of the other man show- red mustache.
The discovery of the bodies primarily
was due to the efforts of Mr. llelge-
lein of Mansliehl SD. brother f
Andrew The lormer bad known of
bis brother"- i rn sp ndence with Mrs.
Gtmness and of the latter's trip to
LaP H-te. When the brother armed

weeks- ago he had been informed in a
letter written by Mrs. Gunness that
his brother had gone to Norway.

	<text>Acting on
private information, Mayor Darrow, of
counsel for Ray Lamphere, who will
be indicted for the murder of Mrs.
Belle Gunness and her three children
and Andrew Helgoleln, of Aberdeen,
S. D tonight entered Into communi
cation by cable with the police ot
Scotland Yard, London, and the au
thoritles in Canadian cities, advising
ttKsm of tho reward of $1000 which
will be paid by Laporte county for tha
finding of tho murdeiess Following
his declaration that tho teeth Identi
fied as those of Mrs. Gunness are in
too perfect condition to have been In
the fierce blaze which destroyed the
head, and charred, baked and burned
the rest of the body, Mayor Darrow,
also took steps to consult with experts
upon whom he relies to disprove tho
identification of tho teeth. Coronor
Mack added the weight of his opinion
that Mrs. Gunness' body was that
found In the ruins of tho charnel
house when ho tonight officially de
clared: "It is my verdict that the body su
viewed is that of Belle Gunness; that
she camo to her death through felon
ious homicide; and that the perpetra
tor thereof Is to me unknown."
Coroner Mack says that so far as
Andrew lfelgelein, of South Dakota;
Ole Budsberg, of Iola, Wis and Jen
nie Olson, the adopted daughter ot
Mrs. Gunness, aro concerned his ver
dict will be that their bodies wero
properly Identified, that they came tn
their death from unnatural causes,
that they were burned to cover up
murder and that Mjrs. Gunness had a
motive for killing them and was guil
ty either alone or with accomplices
of murder.
Mrs. Henry WItzer of Toledo, walk
ed among the dead at the morgue this
morning hoping that there might bo
somo mark of identification on onn of
the skeleton forms which would prova
that her daughter was one of the vic
tlms of the house of tragedy. Tears
rioursed down tho mother's cheeks as
she looked upon the headless and dls
membered bodies. There was no Iden
tification, but the Toledo woman, hop.
ing that some tragedy might solve
the mystery of her daughter's strange
disappearance, came to Laporte like
scores of others, In the hope that the
Gunness murders would unfold th3
mjstery which she has vainly labored
to solve since 3902, when Frances
Witzler, young and pretty, a college
graduato with life before her, left
her home never to return.
Mrs. Witzler believes her daughter
met death in the charnel house.
The grand jury is making splendid

Theie is a disposition on the part of
the stato's attorney, Smith, to conclude
the labors of tho body of inquisition
not later than Friday, when the 'ndict

five, namesake of his father, who. like Sorensen. Is said to have died under
suspicious circumstances.
DH. C. F. MACK, CORONER, TAKING NOTES.
Shortly after the discovery' of the first bodies that had been burled on the
premises of tho Widow Gunness near Laporte, Ind., Dr. C. F. Mack, the
coroner, arrived on the scene nnd wns busy taking notes for official use. The
nine bodies of murdered men and women dug up In the yard near the ruins of
the burned farmhouse passed under Dr. Mack's close scrutiny, as did also
those of the three children and the woman found In the ruins. A Jury composed
of physicians thoroughly examined the charred remains of the children
nnd the woman nnd arrived at the conclusion that they were those of Mrs.
Belle Ounness nnd her little ones. It wns Impossible to determine the sex of
five of the bodies disinterred, they hnvlng been dismembered and also partially
disintegrated by quicklime. Mr. Mack made copious notes for reference

of whom are believed to have been men who were lured to the place by tho I

	<text>THE LA FORTE MURDER FARM.
There Read
Like a Story- of the Mid-Centuries.
Like a chapter from the bloody rec
ords of the mid-centuries is the ter-
rible story unfolded by the authorities
of La Porte, Ind., where wholesale mur
der was done for years without anyone
knowing or suspecting It. Criminal rec
ords contain nc parallel of the grew
some story revealed in the finding of
the clearing house for murders kept by
Mrs. Belle Gunness near the Indiana
town. Just how many persons met
their fate in connection with the bloody
business carried on there will perhaps
never be known. The skeletons dis
covered on her premises and the fact
that expressmen had many times de
livered to her boxes and trunks now
believed to contain human bodies form
the chief materials for the construction
of the strange story of her career. She
is supposed to have lured rich men to
Jier den by matrimonial advertisements
and then made away with them for
their money, and also to have run a
murder "fence" for the benefit of her
partners in the awful trade of human
slaughter, the latter operating in Chi
cago and sending the bodies of their
victims to her for burial. It is the
theory of the prosecution that Mrs.
Gunness deliberately lured men to
her farm by means of an advertisement
in a Chicago newspaper, in which she
represented herself as an attractive and
amiable widow looking for a mate. She
alleged that she was the owner of a
valuable farm and sought a well-to-do
farmer as a husband. After a visit
from such a candidate she generally in
duced him, it appears, to sell his farm
and come to her with the proceeds of
the sale, at which time she would de
liberately murder him and bury his
V>dy en the premises.
For years this strange woman Is
»«al(1 to have conducted her murder mill.
while her neighbors remarked upon her
good humor and her children mingled
with others of their age in the neigh
borhood. And the end of this record
of. crime and mystery is shrouded In

uncertainty. A fire which destroyed
the Gunness borne also disclosed the
fact that her three children had either
been murdered before the fire or that
they had perished in the flames.
In some respects the methods of Mrs.
Belle Gunness seem similar to those
of the infamous Bender family in Kan
sas. Yet it is doubtful if the blood
thirsty Kate Bender in her palmiest
dnjTß was over equal to the awful
crimes that are laid at the door of the
Gunness woman. The story of the La
Porte murder farm recalls the noto-
rioos doings of the Bender family in
Montgomery County, Kan., about forty
years ago, and the famous case of
Henry H. Holmes, who swindled insnr
ino» companies and was held respon-

jible for the murder of quite a long list
3f persons. He was hanged in Phila
delphia. The Benders, husband and
wife and son and daughter, were sap.
posed to have murdered nine or tea
persons and buried the bodies In the
vicinity of their home, robbery being
their motive. The Benders mysteri
ously disappeared and their fate is un
known, although rumora were abroad
at the time that Indignant citizens put
an end to their infamous careers.</text>

Worden was attorney for Ray Lam

the Gunness home and who died in
prison in 1909 He and the negress
were friends
In the shack where the negress
lived and died a skull was found be
tween two mattresses. Conjecture
arose as to whether it might not have
been that of Belle Gunness. A torso
which might have been hers was found
in the ruins of her home, but identifi

was misBlng.
Opinion of those who remembered
Belle Gunness was that the skull
could not have been hers, and It was
recalled that the negress in the prac

skull.
The Incident aroused hope, however
that somewhere letters mght be found
